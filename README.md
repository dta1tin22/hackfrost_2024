# Storm Tracker
## Inspiration
Few months ago, the second largest storm in the world this year, named Yagi, made landfall in northern Vietnam. Many areas suffered significant losses in both lives and property due to the lack of timely access to storm information. Witnessing villages flattened and families engulfed in sorrow, we decided to create this project to not only assist the people of Vietnam but also to ensure that people worldwide can access the fastest and most accurate information about such storms.
