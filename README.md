# Storm Tracker
## Inspiration
Few months ago, the second largest storm in the world this year, named Yagi, made landfall in northern Vietnam. Many areas suffered significant losses in both lives and property due to the lack of timely access to storm information. Witnessing villages flattened and families engulfed in sorrow, we decided to create this project to not only assist the people of Vietnam but also to ensure that people worldwide can access the fastest and most accurate information about such storms.
## How we built it
## Website's purpose
In Storm Tracker, users receive the latest updates on ongoing storms worldwide, along with detailed storm information such as wind speed, affected countries, and severity of damages. Additionally, information about past storms is also available on the website.
## Future goal
In the future, with Kestra, we aim to expand our project so that the users can receive the latest announments and updates from according governments about the storm.
